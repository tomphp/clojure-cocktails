# Cocktail Recipes

This is a self education project. It's is version of the application from the
[Modern Application Development in
PHP](https://leanpub.com/modern-application-development-with-php) book I am
currently working on, but it's written in Clojure. I'm building this alongside
the PHP version as a way to improve my Clojure and to experiment in application
architecture using it.
